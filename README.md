# SoftwareProject-SarcasamDetection

The repository contains two branches: crawling and SPIRS.
In the branch crawling, all code including the two crawled datasets(iSarcasm and SPIRS) can be found, and also the files used for crawling the new dataset.
To crawl the new dataset the following files have to be used in this order: cue_tweets_crawling.py, cue_tweets_filtering.py, thread_crawling_formatting_sarcastic.py.
