# SoftwareProject-SarcasamDetection


In this branch, all code including the two crawled datasets(iSarcasm and SPIRS) can be found, and also the files used for crawling the new dataset.
To crawl the new dataset the following files have to be used in this order: cue_tweets_crawling.py, cue_tweets_filtering.py, thread_crawling_formatting_sarcastic.py.

The file get_tweet_replies_for_nonsar.py was used to crawl non sarcastic tweets and their replies.
